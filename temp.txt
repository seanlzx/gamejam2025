Sure, I’d love to help you out

Mhmm, got any more of those Artefacts first?

(BRANCHING2) Limehold
Perfect! I really appreciate your assistance,

Unfortunately, I got but one on my person. I hope that’s enough when paired with the kindness of your self!

This has been quite the trouble you see. These fake Limeholds below posturing for\nmy position as Happiness. They love to mislead anyone that unwittingly speaks to them!

That’s a real bother.
Clippy

Surely! I’ve been mistaken for them and they me for far too long now.\nThey keep asking the false Limeholds for advice and such.\nWould you be a darling and handle it for me?
